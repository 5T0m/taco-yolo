# Downloading Data

In order to download the data, run
```bash
python download.py
```

The ```download.py``` script is taken from the [original TACO repo](https://github.com/pedropro/TACO).

```Annotations.json``` is included within the downloaded dataset. If TACO dataset has an update, the json file should be updated accordingly as well.
